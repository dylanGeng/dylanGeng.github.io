Presburger arithmetic provides the mathematical core for the polyhedral compilation techniques that drive analytical cache models, loop optimization for ML and HPC, formal verification, and hardware design. Arjun Pitchanathan, Kunwar Shaanjeet Singh Grover, Michel Weber and Tobias Grosser develop FPL, a fast new Presburger library, worked with the LLVM community to make Presburger arithmetic an integral part of the production-focused MLIR compiler framework.

With FPL now a native, performant, and approachable component of the LLVM ecosystem, compiler developers can co-develop the Presburger library and polyhedral transformations with ease. Expect that more scientists and compiler engineers will be able to jointly develop even more IMPACTful polyhedral optimizations.
