Super Vectorize, which provide a single, compact, representation in the vector types, is a very cool feature in MLIR Affine Dialect. It implements a high-level abstracte vectorization strategy on this Function.

Vector granularity
======

This pass is designed to perform vectorization at a super-vector granularity. A super-vector is loosely defined as a vector type that is a multiple of a "good" vector size so the HW can efficiently implement a set of high-level primitives. Multiple is understood along any dimension; e.g. vector<16xf32> and vector<2x8xf32> are valid super-vectors for a vector<8xf32> HW vector. Note that a "good vector size so the HW can efficiently implement a set of high-level primitives" is not necessarily an integer multiple of actual hardware registers. We leave details of this distinction unspecified for now.

Aren't headings cool?
