I am working at Alibaba's T-Head as a Senior Staﬀ Engineer, focusing on AI Compiler, MLIR and Polyhedral Compilation.

I earned my PhD degree from Zhejiang University under supervised by Professor Shi Zheng. And then I worked as a Senior software R&D at [Semitronix](https://www.semitronix.com/?cur_lang=en) responsible for the innovation and development of EDA tools.

Before joining T-Head, I worked at Huawei as a Technical Expert of AI compiler based on Polyhedral Compilation Technology. I am one of the main architect of MindAKG([GitHub](https://github.com/mindspore-ai/akg/blob/master/RELEASE.md), [Gitee](https://gitee.com/mindspore/akg)) which is an open-sourced AI compiler used in Huawei AI framework MindSpore for Huawei Ascend 910 and Nvidia GPU. During the period, I carried out some research and technical cooperation of AI Compilation with [Professor Zhaojie](https://yaozhujia.github.io/), [Professor Cedirc Bastoul](http://icps.u-strasbg.fr/people/bastoul/public_html/) and [Professor Jiang Li](https://cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~jiangli/).

Research Interests
======

- Polyhedral Compilation, Parallel Programming and Optimizations for Heterogeneous Systems
- AI Compiler, Multi-Level IR Compiler Framework (MLIR) and TVM
- Computational Lithography, Design For Manufacturing (DFM)

News
